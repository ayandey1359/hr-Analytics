# HR-Analytics  
Explore the dynamics of human resources through insightful Analytics in my HR Analytics project. This project is about HR metrics, providing valuable insights to optimize workforce management and enhance organizational performance.  
## Processes  
This project's primary goal is to create Dashboard, but before dashboard it is necessary to clean and organised the data,
To understand,clean and organised the data I use **R programming** on R Studio Platform.
After, ensure the data is cleaned and organised, I push the data into ta database, then I  use **Apache Superset** to create interactive Dashboard. Though There is not much opensource Hosting site to Embedded Superset dashboard, so I put all those screenshot in this R Markdown.  

```{r}
# setting-up working directory
getwd()
```
```{r}
# importing libraries 
library(tidyverse)
library(visdat)
library(odbc) 
library(DBI)
```
```{r}
# importing data
data <- read.csv("HR_Analytics.csv", header = TRUE)
head(data)
```
```{r}
# over-looking the entire data
vis_dat(data)
```
Its shows last variable have some NULL values  
```{r}
# look null values Boolean 
any(is.na(data))
```
```{r}
# locate the Null values
which(is.na(data), arr.ind = TRUE)
```
There is many NULL values in the 38 th column.  **NOTED**  

```{r}
# 38 th column overlook
head(data[38])
```
```{r}
glimpse(data)
```
No need the 38 th column for this Analysis.  
```{r}
data <- subset(data, select = -YearsWithCurrManager)
```
```{r}
glimpse(data)
```
```{r}
# see the factor values
table(data$Attrition)
```
```{r}
# convert the data type as factor of Attrition variable
data$Attrition <- as.factor(data$Attrition)
```
```{r}
# check the data type of Attrition variable
class(data$Attrition)
```
```{r}
# create a new variable for Analysis
data <- data %>%
  mutate(Attrition_vector = ifelse(Attrition == "yes", 1, 0))
```
```{r}
# see the mapping 
data %>% select(Attrition,Attrition_vector) %>% head(10)
```
its look not done .. miss mapping..  
let make it ..  
```{r}
# delete the newly created column due to miss mapping
data <- data %>% select(- Attrition_vector)
```
```{r}
# create again that new variable
data <- data %>%
  mutate(Attrition_vector = ifelse(Attrition == "Yes", 1, 0))
```
```{r}
# see the mapping 
data %>% select(Attrition,Attrition_vector) %>% head(10)
```
```{r}
# convert the Attrition_vector column as numeric
data$Attrition_vector <- as.integer(data$Attrition_vector)
```
```{r}
class(data$Attrition_vector)
```
Now the Attrition response converted in to a numeric vector. 
```{r}
# View(data)
```
### Now its Time to push the data into database 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# connecting with database
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                 driver = "PostgreSQL Unicode",
                 server = "localhost",
                 port = 5432,  
                 database = "codeone",
                 uid = "postgres",
                 pwd = "13599")
```
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
```{r}
# let see the list of table in the connected database
dbListTables(con)
```
```{r}
# rename the data-frame before push into data base 
hr_analytics_data <- data
```
```{r}
# now push the data-frame into database
copy_to(con,hr_analytics_data,temporary=FALSE)
```
```{r}
# verify is the data inserted into the data base 
dbListTables(con)
```
Now the cleaned data inserted into the data-base.  
```{r}
# check data type of all variable after pushing into database
query <- "SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'hr_analytics_data';"
result <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
result
```
Now to make dashboard work on RStudio and Apache-Superset Simultaneously.

## Dashboard  
- SQL code while making Dashboard 
```{r}
# Attrition Percentage :: Edit Data :: Metrics :: 
# (sum("Attrition_vector")/COUNT(*)::DECIMAL)*100
```
